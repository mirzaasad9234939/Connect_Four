# Connect_Four
The Connect Four game project is a digital implementation of the classic board game. The game provides an interactive experience where players strategically drop discs into a grid, aiming to connect four discs of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The project supports two modes: single-player and two-player. In the single-player mode, the player competes against an AI opponent. The AI player utilizes a suitable strategy to make its moves, providing a challenging gameplay experience. In the two-player mode, two human players take turns placing their discs on the board, competing against each other to be the first to connect four discs.

The project follows a step-by-step algorithm to facilitate the game flow. It initializes the game board as a 6x7 grid and prompts the user to select the desired game mode. In single-player mode, the player and AI take turns making moves until a win condition is met or the game ends in a tie. The AI player uses an algorithm to evaluate the game state and make strategic decisions. In two-player mode, the two human players alternate turns, placing their discs on the board until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.

The game incorporates features such as input validation to ensure that players can only make valid moves within the bounds of the game board. It also includes win-checking functions to determine if a player has connected four discs and declares the winner accordingly. In case of a tie, the game recognizes when the board is full without any winning combination.

Connect Four game project provides an engaging and strategic gameplay experience, allowing players to enjoy the classic game in a digital format.
